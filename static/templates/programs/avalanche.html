        The NSP Avalanche program is targeted toward educating both general public, and 
        more so ski patrollers, to snow science, travel, and rapid and effective rescue 
        in avalanche terrain. The NSP Avalanche courses fulfill all of the requirements 
        of the level I and II curricula adopted by the 
        <a href="http://www.americanavalancheassociation.org/">
